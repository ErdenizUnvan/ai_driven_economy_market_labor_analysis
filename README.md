# ai_driven_economy_market_vs_labor_analysis

This repository examines how artificial intelligence is reshaping the dynamics between the U.S. financial markets and the labor market.
Using 10 years of historical data from the S&P 500 Index and U.S. Job Openings (JOLTS), the project applies Facebook Prophet to generate 12-month forecasts for both indicators. The analysis reveals a structural divergence: while job openings continue to decline, the S&P 500 maintains a strong upward trajectory driven by AI-enabled productivity, automation, and capital investment in compute-intensive sectors.

The repository includes:

-Time-series cleaning, alignment, and visualization

-Prophet forecasts for both S&P 500 and Job Openings

-Analysis of labor market cooling

-Analysis of AI-driven equity growth

-Macro interpretation of the “AI-era decoupling”

-Combined chart: S&P 500 vs Job Openings (Past + Forecast)

-Jupyter notebook with full reproducible code

This project highlights the emerging post-labor elasticity economy, where AI allows corporations to grow without proportional increases in hiring, leading to a clear divergence between market valuations and labor demand.
